# Code of Conduct

Rules for being in this webring:

1) You must be a member of the Wordmakers writing group. Admin will be checking each submitted site for membership in the group.
2) You must display the webring widget somewhere on your website (preferably in the sidebar or footer). If you need help doing so, please ask under the webring post in the Wordmakers group.
3) If you leave Wordmakers, you must notify admin that you have done so, so you can be removed from the webring. Please message Molly Schlemmer in the group before you leave, or DM Molly on Twitter (@mollyschlemmer) or Instagram (@molly.schlemmer). Temporary lapses in membership will be judged on a case-by-case basis.
4) Follow the Midnight Amendments: #1 - Be cool; #2 - C'mon; #3 - Nice. Rudeness towards other members of the webring can result in being removed from the webring. When in doubt, see Amendment #1.
